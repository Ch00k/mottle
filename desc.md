***Supercharge Your Spotify Experience***

Mottle is a powerful web application that unlocks advanced playlist management features missing from Spotify. Whether
you're a music enthusiast, collector, or casual listener, Mottle transforms how you organize and discover music.

## Complete Artist Discographies

Transform any artist's entire catalog into a perfectly organized playlist with one click. While Spotify makes you
manually hunt down and add each album, single, and EP, Mottle automatically compiles everything into a comprehensive
discography playlist. Perfect for deep dives into your favorite artists or discovering hidden gems you might have
missed.

**Perfect for:** Music collectors, fans exploring new artists, discovering B-sides and rare tracks

## Smart Playlist Merging

Found multiple great playlists for your favorite genre? Don't choose—combine them all. Mottle intelligently merges any
number of playlists into one master collection, letting you create the ultimate soundtrack for any mood or genre.

**Example:** Combine the top 10 "Synthwave" playlists into your personal synthwave mega-mix that captures the full
spectrum of the genre.
